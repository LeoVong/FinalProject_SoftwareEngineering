## Graphical Abstract
![Game Screenshot](screenshot.PNG)  
*Single-player game where users unscramble random popular words against a customizable timer.*

## Purpose of the Software
- **Type of Software Development Process**: Agile  
  - **Why Agile?**: Facilitates iterative feature additions (e.g., difficulty, skip option) with rapid testing. Ideal for a demo-stage project with expansion potential.
- **Possible Usage**: Educational tool for vocabulary and typing practice, casual gaming for entertainment.  
- **Target Market**: Students, educators, casual gamers, language learners.

## Software Development Plan
- **Development Process**: Agile with sprints:  
  - Sprint 1: Core game setup (word unscrambling, timer, basic UI).  
  - Sprint 2: Difficulty levels, randomization, restart functionality.  
  - Sprint 3: Score board, clear scores, expanded word list.  
  - Sprint 4: Sound effects, skip feature, final review.  
- **Members**:  
  - **P2304262 VONG WAI PONG (Frontend Developer)**: Oversees project, develops HTML/CSS structure (20%).  
  - **P2304469 FOK HOU IN (Backend Developer)**: Implements JavaScript logic (game mechanics, scoring, skip feature) (20%).  
  - **P2321073 PAN YUBIN (UI/UX Designer)**: Designs and refines CSS for a basic UI (20%).  
  - **P2321299 WU YIER (Tester & Bug Fixer)**: Tests game, ensures functionality across browsers (20%).  
  - **P2321358 MO XUFENG (Documentation & Demo Specialist)**: Writes documentation, creates demo video (20%).
- **Schedule**:  
  - Week 1 [24 Mar-28 Mar]: Planning, basic setup, core logic.  
  - Week 2 [31 Mar-04 Apr]: Difficulty, random words, restart feature.  
  - Week 3 [07 Apr-11 Apr]: Score board, clear scores, expanded word list.  
  - Week 4 [14 Apr-18 Apr]: Sound effects, skip button, testing, documentation, demo video.
- **Algorithm**:  
  1. Randomly select and scramble 5 words from a 110-word bank.  
  2. Set timer based on difficulty (20-40s).  
  3. Compare user input to original word, update score; allow skipping to next word.  
  4. End game when timeâ€™s up or words are done, save score history.
- **Current Status**: Fully functional demo with difficulty levels, 110+ popular words, random selection, restart, score history, clear scores, sound effects, and a skip feature.  
- **Future Plan**: Add online leaderboards, word categories (e.g., animals, food), mobile optimization.
