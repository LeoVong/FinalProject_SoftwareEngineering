*(A flowchart showing menu → difficulty → game loop → scoring)*

## Purpose of the Software
This is an interactive command-line Number Guessing Game developed in Python. Players choose a difficulty, guess a number, and earn scores saved to a high-score list.

- **Software Development Process**: Waterfall  
  - Chosen for its simplicity and suitability for a small, predictable project.
- **Possible Usage**: Educational tool, casual game for beginners, or demo for learning software development.

## Software Development Plan
- **Development Process**: Waterfall (Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment).
- **Members**:  
  - [Your Name] (Developer, 100% contribution for solo project).
- **Schedule**:  
  - Week 1: Define features and design algorithm.  
  - Week 2: Code menu, game logic, and scoring.  
  - Week 3: Test, document, and record demo.
- **Algorithm**:  
  1. Show menu (start, scores, exit).  
  2. If start: Choose difficulty → Generate number → Loop: Guess, give hints, track attempts → Calculate score → Save high score.  
  3. If scores: Load and display from file.  
  4. If exit: End program.
- **Current Status**: Fully functional demo with menu, difficulty levels, and high scores.  
- **Future Plan**: Add GUI, multiplayer mode, or more difficulty options.

## Environments
- **Programming Language**: Python 3.x  
- **Minimum Requirements**:  
  - Hardware: Any computer with Python installed.  
  - Software: Python 3.x (no additional packages required).  
- **Required Packages**: None (uses `random` and `os` from standard library).

## Declaration
- All code is original, using only Python’s built-in `random` and `os` modules.
